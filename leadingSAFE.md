# Leading SAFe 
+ From Dean Leffingwell, create of SAFe on the high-level overview of Scaled Agile

## Review the case studies
+ Lean Agile mindset
+ Retrospectives read like this:
    + No way to improve systematically
    + Too little visibility
    + Under-estimated dependencies
    + Massive growth in complexity
    + Too early commitment to a design that didn't work
    + Hard to manage distributed teams
    + Late delivery
    + Phase gate SDLC isn't helping reduce risk
    + Problems discovered too late
    + Poor morale
+ Management's challenge
    + _It is not enough that management commit themselves to quality and productivity...They must know what it is they must do. Such a responsibility cannot be delegated._
    _--W. Edwards Deming_
+ " _and if you can't come, send no one" - Vignette from Out of the Crisis, Deming 1986_

## What it is they _must_ do?
+ Embrace a Lean-Agile mindset
+ Implement Lean-Agile practices
+ Lead the implementation
+ Get results

### Embrace Lean-Agile value

### SAFe Lean-Agile Principles
1. Take an economic view
1. Apply system thinking
1. Assume variability; preserve options
1. Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
1. Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems
1. Visualize and limit WIP, Reduce batch sizes, and manage queue lengths
1. Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
1. Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
1. Decentralize decision-making

### Building incrementally accelerated value and delivery

### Agile Teams
+ Cross-functional, self-orgainizng entities that can **define**, **build** and **test** a value stream
+ Apply basic scientific practices: Plan - Do - Check - Adjust

### Integrate frequently
+ Integration points control product development
+ Avoid physical branching for software
+ Frequently integrate hardware branches
+ Use development by intention in inter-team dependencies

### Apply test automation
+ Test automation supports rapid regression testing
+ Implement testing in the same iteration
+ Maintained under version control
+ **Passing** vs. **Not-yet-passing** and *broken automated tests* are the *real* iteration progress indicator

### Agile Release Train
+ Align 50-125 practitioners to a *common* mission
+ Apply cadence and synchronization across the agile teams, Program Increments every 8-12 weeks
+ Provide Vision, Roadmap, architecture guidance

### Architecture Runway
+ Architecture Runway - existing code, hardware components, etc. that technically enable near-term business features
    + Enablers build up the runway
    + Features consume it
    + Architectural Runway must be continuously maintained
    + Enablers extend the runway
