# Leading SAFe 

+ Review the case studies
+ Lean Agile mindset
+ Retrospectives read like this:
    + No way to improve systematically
    + Too little visibility
    + Under-estimated dependencies
    + Massive growth in complexity
    + Too early commitment to a design that didn't work
    + Hard to manage distributed teams
    + Late delivery
    + Phase gate SDLC isn't helping reduce risk
    + Problems discovered too late
    + Poor morale
+ Management's challenge
    + _It is not enough that management commit themselves to quality and productivity...They must know what it is they must do. Such a responsibility cannot be delegated._
    _--W. Edwards Deming_
